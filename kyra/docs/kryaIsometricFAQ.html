      <h1><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Isometric FAQ</font></h1>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a href="kryaFAQ.html">General 
        FAQ</a> | Isometric FAQ</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Using Kyra for an Isometric 
        view is popular enough to warrant its own notes. </font></p>
      <h3><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Overview</font></h3>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The BEM demo:</font></p>
      <h3><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="demo2.jpg" width="320" height="240"></font></h3>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">is an isometric view. Isometric 
        views tend to be more popular on PCs, especially. They are harder to work 
        with, but can make for some spectacular quasi-3D graphics.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Isometric views require lots 
        of animation frames. The Drone BEM can walk in 4 directions, with 6 frames 
        of animation in each direction. Since there is a light source, none of 
        the images are symmetric. So isometric views tent to be content-heavy.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Tiles, generally speaking, 
        are not useful in isometric views. That said, the &quot;space scene&quot; 
        is also a tiled background, so they have their place. But none of the 
        room or character graphics are tiles.</font></p>
      <h3><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Stitching Tiles</font></h3>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Before rendering, you need 
        to decide on how to &quot;stitch&quot; the tiles together. There are many 
        ways to do this, but the BEM tiles use the following rules: </font> </p>
      <ol>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Edges are at a 1 to 2 rise 
          to run ratio.</font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Top corners meet, side corners 
          do not.</font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The center needs to be chosen 
          consistently. The top and left of the 4 possible &quot;middle&quot; 
          pixels, for instance.</font></li>
      </ol>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="tileDeconstruction.gif" width="301" height="171"></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The rules applied to 4 colored 
        tiles are shown above. There are other valid rules; this just happens 
        to be the one the BEM chooses. Note that the &quot;mathematical&quot; 
        width of the sprite is 2 pixels wider than the image width, and the mathematical 
        height is 2 pixels smaller than the image. See 'BemGame::MapToScreen' 
        for a mapping from map coordinates to screen coordinates.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When rendering or drawing the 
        graphics, you need to be careful in the placement of the camera in order 
        to get the correct edge angle.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">While cleaning up the graphics, 
        it is important to make sure you have good clean edges so the tiles match 
        up correctly. This is a tedious aspect to working with isometric views. 
        Keep some templates around to help you clean up the images. For example, 
        in the picture above, almost all tiles will be clipped by the 2 bottom 
        white triangles that are the negative space of the image. So repeated 
        shapes can be pasted in to the image to clip it. The top edge is harder; 
        as many shapes will extend upwards and the top edge sometimes has to be 
        &quot;hand clipped.&quot;</font></p>
      <h3><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Depth Sorting</font></h3>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Depth sorting of isometric 
        images is performed in increasing world Z, with sprites at the same world 
        Z sorted based on the screen Y value of their center point. (A little 
        strange, granted, but works.) The BEM demo has 2 Z depths: 1) the floor 
        and 2) everything standing on the floor. The 2 depths are simply sorted 
        into 2 ImNodes which are then sub-sorted. Everything inside is ZDepth 
        sorted based on 'actor[i].sprite->Y()'. The hotspots of the sprites are 
        set between their feet.</font></p>
      <h4><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Another Example of Depth Sorting</font></h4>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">An example came up, for a fantasy 
        game, of how to sort the following: </font> 
      <ul>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">An Orc in a room.</font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A table.</font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A vase on the table.</font></li>
      </ul>
      <p></p>
      <p></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Assume the floor is flat. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Start by considering basic 
        relationships. In 3D space, the orc and table will always be at a higher 
        3D-Z than the floor, since they're standing on it. This implies that in 
        any visual representation, the table and the orc will *always* be drawn 
        on top of the floor. There are 2 levels to this example: </font> 
      <ul>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The floor.</font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The things on the floor.</font></li>
      </ul>
      <p></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So in an isometric space, the 
        orc and table are in a higher z-range or in a higher layer than the floor. 
        The trick becomes (in isometric space) what is the z-depth of the orc 
        vs. the table, but the floor is irrelevant. So consider then the orc and 
        the table. The orc and the table can't be in the same position because 
        that would be visually and physically wrong. It turns out that in an isometric 
        view for objects with a square bounding box, the z-depth within a layer 
        is proportional to the y position in screen coordinates. (Once the idea 
        occurs to you -- and you draw out that rather absurd property on paper 
        -- it actually makes sense visually.) That sorts the orc relative to the 
        table.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now, the vase. The vase is 
        both hard and easy. Conceptually tricky because the vase and the table 
        are at the same layer: the "things on floor" layer. Hard because the mathematical 
        transformation is fairly gruesome for a quasi-3D engine. Easy if you cheat. 
        Vase is as close to the table as possible. Vase ZDepth = Table ZDepth 
        + 1. In Kyra you could also use containment. If the table is an Image 
        of some kind (likely a sprite), the child images of the table are the 
        things on the table, and it all works out.</font></p>
      <h2><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Math</font></h2>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">An isometric view is a true 
        representation of a 3D world from a particualar camera viewpoint. (A camera 
        an infinite distance away, but that's a mathematical detail.) The class 
        GlIsoMath is provided to assist in 3D to 2D transforms used by the engine. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">it is important to note that 
        you are dealing with sprites. (You knew, that, I grant you.) But that 
        has some important side effects: a sprite can usually move from one location 
        to another based on its art. Often you know the screen transformation, 
        and need the new location in 3D space. IsoMath will transform in both 
        directions. </font></p>
