iPhone/iPad:

In order to create games for iPhone or iPad, first you need to export the game (or the game levels) as "Game Data Only".
The first level must have the same name of the Product Name (your game name).
For example, if the product name is "TheGame", the first level file must be "TheGame.dat".
After get the exported .dat files, add the files in the xcode project (as a new resource), 
update the custom info you want (game icon, your name, game name, ...)
and build the project.
