To compile the gameEditor (current interface) open the solution file gameEditlr.sln and build the gameEditor project (this will create the file gameEditor.exe in the output directory).

To compile the new interface (not functional yet) you need to build the wxGameEditor project thats have the follow dependencies:

1) Get the wxWidgets at http://www.wxwidgets.org/ (wxAll version)

Put the follow dirs in your include path:

wxWidgets/include
wxWidgets/include/msvc
wxWidgets/contrib/include
wxWidgets/contrib/wxstedit/include

Put the follow llvm dirs in your library path:

wxWidgets/lib/vc_lib

Open the wx.dsw project
Configure all projects of the wxWidgets to:
Multi-threaded (/MT or /MTd)

Disable the "Edit and Continue" option of the Visual Studio
Build all projects 


2) The LLVM is not used now, but are some tests in the code to generate C code from the Behavior panel. 
To get the LLVM and clang (you need to get the last version via svn, but if you can't compile the last version the revision 83257 runs ok) (optional for while, look the USE_LLVM definition)

cd llvm
svn co http://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/llvm/trunk .

cd tools
svn co http://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/cfe/trunk clang 

If you are using the Windows to build, get the cmake (http://cmake.org/) and generate the Visual Studio files with the follow configuration:

CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:llvm/bin (or other path you want)
LLVM_BUILD_EXAMPLES:false
LLVM_BUILD_TOOLS:true
LLVM_ENABLE_ASSERTIONS:true
LLVM_ENABLE_PIC:false
LLVM_ENABLE_THREADS:true
LLVM_TABLEGEN:tblgen
LLVM_TARGETS_TO_BUILD:ARM;CBackend;CppBackend;Mips;MSIL;PowerPC;X86
LLVM_TARGET_ARCH:host


Put the follow llvm dirs in your include path (llvm/bin is the path you have used to compile the llvm):

llvm/tools/clang/include
llvm/include
llvm/bin/include
llvm/bin/tools/clang/include
llvm/win32 (for compilation on Windows)

Put the follow llvm dirs in your library path:

llvm/bin/lib

Build the ALL_BUILD project

Linux: (tested on Kubuntu 9.10 64bits)


1) Open a terminal window
2) Install the libx11-dev (if not installed on your system) 
	sudo apt-get update
	sudo apt-get install libx11-dev libxpm-dev x11proto-xext-dev libxext-dev

3) Make sure you have the gcc and g++ installed. If not, install it:	
	sudo apt-get install g++
		
		
4) Install the 32bit library if you are using a 64bit linux (Game Editor was not ported to 64bit yet)
	sudo apt-get install libc6-dev-i386
	sudo apt-get install lib32stdc++6	
	sudo apt-get install g++-multilib
	sudo apt-get install ia32-libs
	
5) Go to the Game Editor directory
6) type: make
7) copy the contents of the directory gameEditor/res to output/editor

To Compile the engines on Windows:

In the Visual Studio 2008, choose the version you want to compile:

	- View->Property Manager
	- In gameEditor project , _BaseConfiguration of any configuration, in the User Macros put the configuration you want in the VersionType.
	  The configurations are: Professional and Standalone_Pro
	  For compile the engines, use: VersionType = $(Standalone_Pro)

- To compile the Pocket PC engine, select the 'Pocket PC 2003 (ARMV4)' configuration (you need to to get the PocketHAL library at http://www.droneship.com)

- To make a Pocket PC compilation works in the Pocket PC 2002, uses: /subsystem:windowsce,3.00 /MACHINE:ARM	
  In the MSVC 2008, this flag is not working so, the genarated executable have the windowsce 5.00 subsystem.
  To solve this issue, you need a Portable Executable editor (PE Editor) to change the follow configuration in the Optional Header to:
  
	- OS Major Version: 0004 (Address 0x00000128) in the executable file)
	- SubSys Major Version: 0003 (Address 0x00000130) in the executable file)

- To compile for the GP2X select the 'Windows Mobile 5.0 Pocket PC SDK (ARMV4I)' configuration (you need to install the Windows Mobile 5.0 SDK for Pocket PC and have the devkitpro installed (http://www.devkitpro.org/))
		
- Build the gameEditor project (not the wxGameEditor project)

- To compile the Linux engine set the GAMEEDITOR_TYPE to GAMEEDITOR_PROFESSIONAL_STAND_ALONE in the makefile
		
- Copy the executable files to the bin directory without any extensions:
  
	gameEditor.exe		-> bin\\gameEditorWindows
	gameEditorPocket.exe		-> bin\\gameEditorPocket
	gameEditorLinux				-> bin\\gameEditorLinux
	gameEditorPocket.exe.gpe	-> bin\\gameEditorGP2X
	gameEditorIphone			-> bin\\gameEditorIphone
