To compile the gameEditor (current interface) and wxGameEditor (new interface) projects:

1) Get the RakNet at http://www.jenkinssoftware.com/ (tested with the 3.301 version)

Configure the LibStatic project to:
Multi-threaded (/MT or /MTd)

2) Get the LLVM and clang (you need to get the last version via svn) (optional for while, look the USE_LLVM definition)

cd llvm
svn co http://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/llvm/trunk .

cd tools
svn co http://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/cfe/trunk clang 

Put the follow llvm dirs in your include path:

llvm/tools/clang/include
llvm/include
llvm/win32

Put the follow llvm dirs in your library path:

llvm/win32

Configure all projects of the LLVM to:
Multi-threaded (/MT or /MTd)

Build the clang project

3) Get the wxWidgets at http://www.wxwidgets.org/ (wxAll version)

Put the follow dirs in your include path:

wxWidgets/include
wxWidgets/include/msvc
wxWidgets/contrib/include
wxWidgets/contrib/wxstedit/include

Put the follow llvm dirs in your library path:

wxWidgets/lib/vc_lib

Open the wx.dsw project
Configure all projects of the wxWidgets to:
Multi-threaded (/MT or /MTd)

Build all projects

To Compile the engines on Windows:

In the Visual Studio 2008, choose the version you want to compile:

	- View->Property Manager
	- In gameEditor project , _BaseConfiguration of any configuration, in the User Macros put the configuration you want in the VersionType.
	  The configurations are: Professional and Standalone_Pro
	  For compile the engines, use: VersionType = $(Standalone_Pro)

- To compile the Pocket PC engine, select the 'Pocket PC 2003 (ARMV4)' configuration (you need to to get the PocketHAL library at http://www.droneship.com)

- To make a Pocket PC compilation works in the Pocket PC 2002, uses: /subsystem:windowsce,3.00 /MACHINE:ARM	
  In the MSVC 2008, this flag is not working so, the genarated executable have the windowsce 5.00 subsystem.
  To solve this issue, you need a Portable Executable editor (PE Editor) to change the follow configuration in the Optional Header to:
  
	- OS Major Version: 0004
	- SubSys Major Version: 0003

- To compile for the GP2X select the 'Windows Mobile 5.0 Pocket PC SDK (ARMV4I)' configuration (you need to install the Windows Mobile 5.0 SDK for Pocket PC and have the devkitpro installed (http://www.devkitpro.org/))
		
- Build the gameEditor project (not the wxGameEditor project)
		
- Use the GameControl::CreateEngines() function to create the bin files from the compiled executables:
  transforma os arquivos .exe em .bin compactados:
  
	gameEditorWindows.exe		-> bin\\windows.bin
	gameEditorPocket.exe		-> bin\\pocketpc.bin
	gameEditorLinux				-> bin\\linux.bin
	gameEditorPocket.exe.gpe	-> bin\\gp2x.bin

Linux:

1) Open a console window
2) Go to the Game Editor directory
3) type: make
4) copy the contents of the directory gameEditor/res to output/editor
