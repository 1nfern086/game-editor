Changes in version 1.1.3 beta (2008-01-17):
-------------------------------------------
- Updated code to use wxList::compatibility_iterator instead of pointers to wxNode class (so the
  STL lists are supported now).
- Each xsSerializable class instance added to the wxXmlSerializer container now knows its
  parent (functions xsSerializable::GetParentManager() and xsSerializable::SetParentManager() were added).
- Added new sample project (Sample4)
- Simplified older samples (why to do it in a complex way when it can be done in a simple way?:) )
  (please delete old saved XML configuration files).

Changes in version 1.1.2 beta (2007-12-21):
-------------------------------------------
- Instances of xsSerializable and wxXmlSerializer classes can be now cloned. This
  functionality is provided by special XS_DECLARE_CLONABLE_CLASS and XS_IMPLEMENT_CLONABLE_CLASS
  which must be used instead of classic macros DECLARE_DYNAMIC_CLASS and IMPLEMENT_DYNAMIC_CLASS
  in all derived classes which should be clonable. In this case the clonable class provides
  Clone() function which creates and returns a copy of the class instance done via its 
  copy constructor (it must be defined by the user).
- Added function wxXmlSerializer::CopyItems() which allow user to do full copy of given
  data manager (serializer). Note that stored content must be clonable (class instances must
  include the Clone() funtion (see the previous paragraph)). 
- Fixed possible memory leak in xsListRealPointPropIO data handler.

Changes in version 1.1.1 beta (2007-12-10):
-------------------------------------------
- Added wxChar support
- Fixed build of library samples on Linux
- Fixed build of "CustomDataSample" sample with MinGW compiler on MS Windows platform

Changes in version 1.0.0 beta (2007-12-04):
-------------------------------------------
- Initial public release.
